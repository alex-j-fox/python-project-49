# Brain Games

"Brain Games" - is a collection of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. Games:

- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions, that need to be calculated
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
- Even or Odd. Determining an even number
- GCD. Determining the greatest common divisor
- Prime Number. Definition of a prime number

## Minimal requirements

- Python version 3.10
- Git version 2.25
